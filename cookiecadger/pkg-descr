Cookie Cadger helps identify information leakage 
from applications that utilize insecure HTTP GET 
requests.

Web providers have started stepping up to the plate 
since Firesheep was released in 2010. Today, most 
major websites can provide SSL/TLS during all 
transactions, preventing cookie data from leaking 
over wired Ethernet or insecure Wi-Fi. But the fact 
remains that Firesheep was more of a toy than a tool. 
Cookie Cadger is the first open-source pen-testing tool 
ever made for intercepting and replaying specific insecure 
HTTP GET requests into a browser.

Cookie Cadger is a graphical utility which harnesses the 
power of the Wireshark suite and Java to provide a fully 
cross-platform, entirely open- source utility which can monitor 
wired Ethernet, insecure Wi-Fi, or load a packet capture 
file for offline analysis.
