dnmap is a framework to distribute nmap 
scans among several clients. It reads an 
already created file with nmap commands 
and send those commands to each client 
connected to it.

The framework use a client/server architecture. 
The server knows what to do and the clients do 
it. All the logic and statistics are managed in 
the server. Nmap output is stored on both server 
and client.

Usually you would want this if you have to 
scan a large group of hosts and you have 
several different internet connections (or 
friends that want to help you).
